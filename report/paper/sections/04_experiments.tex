\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

I structure the experiments around a lean, single-seed comparison at fastMRI R=6, ACS=20: a capacity-matched real U-Net versus a complex U-Net trained on 8,192/1,024 slices, with identical masks, seeds, and optimizer. The goals are to (1) quantify the gap between the two models on the validation set (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}), (2) examine training dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:training_curve}), and (3) show matched qualitative reconstructions at fixed validation indices (Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative}), while logging configs/checkpoints for reproducibility.

\subsection{Runs and configurations}
\label{sec:exp-runs}
Each experiment reuses the training pipeline from Section~\ref{sec:methodology}. I seed the data loaders, model weights, and masking so that the real and complex-valued models see the exact same batches. Two runs are executed: a complex U-Net with the base widths $[16,32,64,128,256]$, and a real U-Net with the same widths scaled by $1.42\times$ for parameter parity (about 12.6M parameters). Optimizer, schedule, and checkpoints are identical across the two learned models. All learned runs use 8{,}192 training slices and 1{,}024 validation slices.

\subsection{Metrics and logging}
\label{sec:exp-metrics}
For every checkpoint that saves to \texttt{results/}, my notebooks record $\ell_1$ loss, PSNR, and SSIM on the validation set. Epoch-level aggregates are serialized to JSON for easy plotting, while the best and most recent checkpoints (plus qualitative reconstructions at a fixed validation index) are stored as well. I will reference the quantitative summary in Table~\ref{tab:main_results} and qualitative grids in Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative}.

\subsection{Analyses}
\label{sec:exp-analysis-plan}
This study reports (1) side-by-side PSNR/SSIM/$\ell_1$ for the real and complex U-Nets on the validation subset (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}), (2) training dynamics via loss/PSNR curves (Figure~\ref{fig:training_curve}), and (3) matched qualitative slices for both models (Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative}). \textbf{The checkpoints used for all direct comparisons were those with the lowest $\ell_1$ loss on the validation set.}
