% TODO(Conclusion): Update claims once quantitative results are finalized; adjust if complex underperforms real baseline.
\section{Conclusion}
I implemented and trained parameter-matched real and complex U-Nets on a trimmed fastMRI knee subset, logging zero-fill baselines, training curves, and qualitative slices for reproducibility. The repo now contains scripts, configs, and publication-ready figures/tables that make the comparison transparent, regardless of whether the complex model ultimately outperforms the real baseline. Remaining work includes scaling to larger datasets, adding phase-aware metrics, and extending beyond U-Nets, but the core pipeline is in place for others to reproduce or extend these findings.
