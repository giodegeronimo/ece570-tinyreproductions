\section{Conclusion}
I implemented and trained parameter-matched real and complex U-Nets on a trimmed fastMRI knee subset with equispaced masks at $R=6$ (ACS=20). The complex model delivered a modest but consistent lift over the real baseline (25.49 vs.
25.10 dB PSNR; 0.887 vs.
0.785 SSIM; lower $\ell_1$), using the same seeds, optimizer, and schedule. The repo now includes scripts, configs, checkpoints, and publication-ready figures/tables so the comparison can be reproduced or extended. Future work includes scaling to larger datasets, adding phase-sensitive metrics, and exploring architectures beyond U-Nets.
