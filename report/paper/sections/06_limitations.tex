\section{Limitations and Future Work}
This reproduction is intentionally narrow: I train a single seed on 16{,}384/1{,}024 slices for 12 epochs at $R=6$ with equispaced masks. Reproducing the full scope of \citet{cole2020analysisdeepcomplexvaluedconvolutional} would require multiple datasets, accelerations, and activation variants (e.g., modReLU, zReLU), plus more systematic hyperparameter sweeps. I also limit evaluation to magnitude-based PSNR/SSIM/$\ell_1$, whereas the original paper emphasized phase reconstruction quality; adding velocity/phase-sensitive metrics would strengthen the story. Future work includes multi-coil experiments, broader acceleration ranges, activation ablations, and robustness checks to mask offsets.
